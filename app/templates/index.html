  <p class="lead">
    This project was created for my INF601 Final Project and it builds on the concept
    introduced in my Mini Project Three. My goal from the beginning was to create a calm and
    meaningful space where users can slow down and check in with themselves without feeling
    overwhelmed. I wanted a simple tool that encourages reflection and emotional awareness
    through gentle, approachable design.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application allows users to save daily reflections, select their mood, and receive
    a motivational quote that matches how they are feeling. This brings the idea from my original
    project proposal to life and adds more depth by connecting the users emotional patterns with
    helpful guidance.

    <li>Track your emotional patterns through a mood chart</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Technical Explanation -->

  <h3 class="mb-3">How This Works</h3>

  <p>
    This application uses the ZenQuotes API to gather inspirational and mood based quotes.
    Instead of displaying a random quote, the app looks at the users selected mood and chooses
    a quote that feels appropriate for that emotional state. This gives the quote more meaning
    and connects it to the users experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dashboard includes a chart generated with Matplotlib that shows how often each mood
    has been selected. This makes it easy to see patterns over time and gives the user a simple
    visual summary of their emotional journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together these features bring both mindfulness and technology together in a clear and
    supportive way while staying true to the goals laid out in my original project proposal.

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Mindful Moments Tracker is my INF601 Final Project. I built it as a simple place
    to pause, check in, and notice how each day feels. Users can write short notes,
    choose a mood, and receive a supportive quote through the ZenQuotes API.

    This project builds on what I learned earlier in the semester with Flask,
    templates, forms, databases, and API integration.

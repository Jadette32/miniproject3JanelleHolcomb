  <h2>About the Mindful Moments Tracker</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    This application was created for my INF601 Final Project. The goal was to take
    the mini project from earlier in the semester and build it into something more
    complete, personal, and functional while demonstrating the skills I learned
    throughout the course.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mindful Moments Tracker is designed to be a calm and supportive space for
    self reflection. It helps users slow down, look inward, and understand their
    emotional patterns over time. The design stays soft and simple so the user can
    focus on how they feel rather than the complexity of the interface.

  <h3>Technical Overview</h3>

  <p>
    This project uses Flask as the main framework. It includes a full folder
    structure with blueprints for clean separation of pages and authentication.
    A SQLite database stores users, reflections, and moods. The ZenQuotes API
    provides mood related quotes, and Matplotlib is used to generate the visual
    mood chart on the dashboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    These features demonstrate database management, user authentication,
    API integration, visualization techniques, and modular application design
    which were all key components of the course.

  <h3>About the Creator</h3>

  <p>
    My name is Janelle Holcomb and I am a Computer Science student. As a mom, a
    college student, and someone who values mindfulness, I wanted this project
    to feel warm, simple, and genuinely supportive. I focused on creating an
    environment that encourages gentle reflection while also showcasing real
    technical growth.
